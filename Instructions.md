Git commits:

Your process is correct! Hereâ€™s a clear summary:

Edit a file:

It appears in Changes (unstaged).
Stage (+) a file:

It moves to Staged Changes.
If you edit the file again, you must stage it again to update the staged version.
Commit:
git ommit -m xx " (-m is for message)

Only the files in Staged Changes are saved in the commit.
Unstaged changes remain local and are not committed.
Push:

After you commit, use push (git push) to upload your commits to the remote repository (GitHub).
Push only sends committed changes to GitHub.
You should push after every commit (or after a batch of commits) to keep GitHub up to date.
Summary:

Push after you commit to sync your local commits with GitHub.
Unstaged changes are always local until you stage, commit, and push.

see which branch you are in:
git branch
