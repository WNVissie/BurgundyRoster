## Next session (2025-08-13): Bugfixes and features

### To Do for Tomorrow

	- [ ] Add reports (employee history, etc)
	- [ ] Check licenses (Admin - get licenses?)
	- [ ] Check why timesheets are not generating
	- [ ] Check that recent activity pulls through
	- [ ] Test employee user
	- [ ] Add leave to employee automatically when leave is approved (in roster?)
	- [ ] Analytics: Employees by area not showing
	- [ ] Analytics: Shifts analysis not showing
	- [ ] Analytics: How performance is calculated
	- [ ] Analytics: Skills distribution pulled through?
	- [ ] Analytics: Designation calling designations table
	- [ ] Employee form: Rates not showing
	- [ ] Test community: add functionality for Q&A and to add Q&A answered in community notice board
	- [ ] Test support: set up
	- [ ] Test multiple sending to WhatsApp and email

	- [ ] Add registration page for new employees (manual signup with company email and password).
	- [ ] Support login with both company email/password and Google OAuth.
	- [ ] Update user records with real company emails when available.

	- [x] Reproduce: drag shift in Roster; confirm it doesn’t assign and note any errors.
	- [ ] Backend: verify GET /api/shifts and /api/roster responses; check CORS/auth; confirm assign/create endpoints exist and payload shapes.
	- [ ] Frontend: ensure drop handler calls backend and updates UI optimistically; handle error states.
	- [ ] Acceptance: user can drag a shift onto a slot, it persists on refresh; no “Failed to fetch shift data”.

## Quick Start Commands

**Backend (Flask):**
```cmd
python shift-roster-backend\src\main.py
```

**Frontend (React/Vite):**
```cmd
cd shift-roster-frontend
npm
```

- Roles: “failed to fetch data” (Admin)
	- [ ] Verify /api/roles route, permissions (Admin bypass), and axios base URL.
	- [ ] Acceptance: Roles list loads for Admin without errors.

- Cannot add data (general)
	- [ ] Re-test create on Employees, Roles, Areas, Skills; fix any 4xx/5xx and validation mismatches.
	- [ ] Acceptance: Can add each entity successfully; toast confirms; list refreshes.

- Analytics: dummy/incorrect data and fetch failures
	- [ ] Replace any stubbed responses with real queries; ensure date range handling; seed sufficient sample data.
	- [ ] Acceptance: Dashboard/Analytics load with real counts; no 401/422; charts match DB state.

- Timesheets
	- [ ] Define model + endpoints (create, approve, export); add UI page & basic workflow.
	- [ ] Acceptance: Generate timesheets for a period, approve/reject, and view status.

- Reports
	- [ ] Specify report types (attendance, hours by employee/area, coverage); implement CSV/PDF exports.
	- [ ] Acceptance: User can generate and download selected reports with correct filters.

- Seed/sample data
	- [ ] Create/refresh dev seeds: employees, roles, areas, skills, shifts, roster assignments for realistic analytics.
	- [ ] Acceptance: Fresh setup yields usable demo data across pages.

- Diagnostics to capture (for quick triage)
	- [ ] Browser console + Network tab errors for failing actions.
	- [ ] Backend flask.log snippets and request/response samples (status, URL, payload).
	- [ ] Exact steps to reproduce for each failure.

## Project Technical Notes & Feature Requirements

- NOTE: DATA WAS SEEDED AND HARDCODED FOR TESTING – WITH ALL REQUESTS NOW THE APIS AND ALL SHOULD POINT TO THE DATABASE
- NOTE THAT EMAILS ARE DUMMIES EXCEPT FOR WANDA.NEZAR AND KAILETH.PHELAN (David Viljoen) – use these two for authentication testing.
- Remove all authorisation until testing has been completed – only then start testing authorisations.
- Admin – have access to all, Managers have access to all
- Add guest to roles – guest can only see the shift roster and analytics and dashboard and must have a username and password
- Run a check vs the schema of the code vs schema of the database to indicate if any fields are not called or populated – misaligned
- Check that data in the app is fetched from the database and not hard coded data on the UI
- Generate Timesheet that pulls data from the database and that the timesheet data is generated from the roster and populated in the database
- Fix weekly analysis chart
- Create UI for leave table and allow approval of leave by managers only. Populate roster when leave has been requested.
- Create a leave view that shows all leave data – with approvals, who approved and date of approval
- Add to the role table an easier way to assign access to tables and views so that admin can switch on or off when access changes.
- Create export buttons for the shifts and timesheets and add WhatsApp functionality to allow a shift to be shared via WhatsApp to a single employee (add in the shift roster at employee name)
- Allow copy paste for a group of employees (can be selected by tickboxes selecting multiple users) to be shared to a WhatsApp group.
- Allow sharing of shifts via email (include icon in the shift roster to click and send route to employee email)
- Allow sharing of shifts via a group email setup to email all in the group
- Add a community board with Q&A that all can post, managers and admin can moderate and also a WhatsApp direct chat for them to try to contact admin (or a manager)
